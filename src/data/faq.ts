    question: "What industries do you specialize in?",
    answer:
      "Mainly SaaS, healthcare, and fintech — though I've also worked on landing pages, admin dashboards, and mobile app concepts across other domains.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your design process like?",
    answer:
      "Four stages, always in the same order: discovery and research, wireframing, final visual design, then developer handoff. Nothing moves forward until the stage before it is signed off.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you also code?",
    answer:
      "I build production-ready front-ends in React, Next.js and Tailwind. That means handoff files are written by someone who has to implement them, so the specs actually hold up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you available for freelance work?",
    answer:
      "Yes — I take on two client projects at a time, typically four to eight week engagements. Retainers are available once the first project ships.",
  },
  {
    question: "What tools do you use?",
    answer:
      "Figma for design and prototyping, Maze and Hotjar for research, Linear for tracking, and VS Code plus GSAP for anything that needs to move.",
  },
